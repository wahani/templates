Title: A System for Working with Templates
Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R: person("Sebastian", "Warnholz", email = "wahani@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides tools to work with template code and text in R. It aims to
    provide a simple substitutions mechanism for R-expressions inside these
    templates. Templates can be written in other languages like 'SQL', can
    simply be represented by characters in R, or can themselves be R-expressions
    or functions.
